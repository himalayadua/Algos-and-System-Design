**Questions**
1. Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. 
    - Imagine you’re in a library full of books. 
    - To find a book quickly, it’s essential that they are organized in a systematic way. 
    - Libraries often sort books using the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which groups books on similar subjects together. 
    - Within each subject, books might be sorted alphabetically by the author’s last name or by the book’s title.
    - sorting process can be broken down:
        - Categorization: Books are first categorized by their main subject area, such as literature, science, or history.
        - Sub-categorization: Within each category, books are further sorted into sub-categories. For example, in science, books could be sorted into physics, chemistry, and biology.
        - Alphabetical Order: Within each sub-category, books are then arranged in alphabetical order by the author’s surname or the book title.
        - Numerical Order: If the library uses the Dewey Decimal system, books are given a numerical code based on their subject, which also helps in sorting.
