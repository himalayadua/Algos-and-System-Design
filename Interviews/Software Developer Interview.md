Here's a very simple answer for this question:

1.  Problem Solving.
    -   For example, interviewer might you ask you [Next Greater Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/) problem.

2.  Algorithms & Data Structures like Arrays, Linked List, Trees etc. (More details about this in Upcoming Posts)
    -   For example, you might get a question like [All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/) problem.

3.  System Design - High-Level Design & Low-Level Design (ONLY for SENIOR POSITIONS like SDE-II)
    -   HLD question like [Design WhatsApp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7LtmfFYjc4&t=1028s).
    -   LLD question like [Design Elevator System](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/object-oriented-design/559454/OOD-Design-elevator-system) using Object-Oriented Programming Principles & Design Patterns
