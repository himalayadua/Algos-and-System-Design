# Fault Tolerance, Resilience, Reliability
-   **Error**: An incorrect internal state.
-   **Fault**: A component's incorrect behavior.
-   **Failure**: When a system as a whole stops providing the required service.
-   **Fault Tolerance**: Ability of a system to behave in a well-defined manner once a fault occurs.
-   **Resilience**: Ability to return to a normal state after a failure.
-   **Game Day vs Chaos Engineering**: Game Day is a planned simulation. Chaos Engineering is introducing random failures.
-   **Reliability**: Probability a system will fail in a given period.
