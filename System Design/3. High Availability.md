# High Availability
Availability is a measure of system uptime.

-   **Time-based**: E.g., 99.9% (or "three nines") uptime.
-   **Count-based**: E.g., 1 failure allowed in 1 million requests.
-   **Design Principles**: Redundancy, failover, replication, monitoring, and regular testing.
-   **Processes**: Regular maintenance, backup procedures, disaster recovery planning.
-   **SLO vs SLA**: Service Level Objective (SLO) is the target level of service. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the contract with the customer promising certain SLOs.
