# Asynchronous Messaging Patterns:

    Message Queuing: Temporarily storing messages to be processed later.
    Publish/Subscribe: Senders (publishers) send messages to channels without specifying receivers. Receivers (subscribers) subscribe to channels they're interested in.
    Competing Consumers: Multiple consumers process messages from a single channel, distributing load.
    Request/Response Messaging: A two-way messaging pattern; a request is followed by a response.
    Priority Queue: Messages are processed based on priority rather than order of arrival.
    Claim Check: Large message is dropped off at a service and a claim check is provided to the requester, which can be used to get the full message later.
