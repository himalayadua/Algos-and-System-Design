# **Performance**:

-   **Latency**: Time taken to process a single operation.
-   **Throughput**: Number of operations processed in a given time period.
-   **Percentiles**: E.g., 95th percentile latency = under which 95% of the request latencies fall.
-   **How to Increase**: Optimize algorithms, caching, distributed systems.
