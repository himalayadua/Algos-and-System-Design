# Blocking Queue and Producer-Consumer Pattern:

    Producer-Consumer Pattern: Separate components that produce and consume data, often operating at different rates.
    Wait and Notify: Mechanisms to synchronize between producers and consumers.
    Semaphores: A synchronization primitive used to control access to a shared resource.
    Blocking Queue Applications: Used in thread pooling, task scheduling, etc.
