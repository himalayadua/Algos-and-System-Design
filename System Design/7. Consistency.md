# Consistency:

Ensuring all users see the same data.

    Eventual Consistency: Data will become consistent over time.
    Linearizability: Real-time consistency.
    Monotonic Reads: If a process reads the value of a data item, any successive reads by that process will always return that value or a more recent one.
    Read-Your-Writes: Guarantees that a write by a process is visible to a subsequent read by the same process.
    Consistent Prefix Reads: Guarantees that every read receives a prefix (some initial segment) of the writes, in order.
