# Log:

    Memory vs. Disk: Storing logs in volatile memory (faster, but not persistent) vs. non-volatile disk storage (slower but persistent).
    Log Segmentation: Splitting logs into segments to manage them more efficiently.
    Message Position (Offset): The position of a message within a log.
