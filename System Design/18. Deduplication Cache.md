# Deduplication Cache:

    Local vs. External Cache: Storage close to the CPU vs. external storage systems.
    Adding Data to Cache: Can be added explicitly by the application or implicitly by the caching system.
    Cache Data Eviction: Removing data from cache, can be based on size, time, or other criteria.
    Expiration vs. Refresh: Time after which data is removed vs. updating data periodically.
