# Physical Servers to Serverless:

    Physical Servers: Tangible hardware running software.
    Virtual Machines (VMs): Emulated computer systems.
    Containers: Lightweight VMs that share the same OS kernel and isolate the application processes from each other.
        Pros: Lightweight, fast, consistent environment, scalable.
        Cons: Less isolation than VMs.
    Serverless: Cloud-computing model which can run individual functions in response to events. Resources are fully managed by the cloud provider.
        Pros: Scalability, no infrastructure management, cost-effective.
        Cons: Cold starts, limited customization, statelessness.
