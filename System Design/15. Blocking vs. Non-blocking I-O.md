# Blocking vs. Non-blocking I/O:

    Blocking I/O: The process is blocked until data is available.
    Non-blocking I/O: The process continues even if the data is not available.
    Thread per Connection Model: Each connection gets a dedicated thread.
    Thread per Request with Non-blocking I/O Model: Threads are used only when processing a request.
    Event Loop Model: Single thread handles multiple connections using events.
    Concurrency vs. Parallelism: Concurrency is multiple tasks starting, running, and completing in overlapping time periods, while parallelism is multiple tasks running at exactly the same time.
