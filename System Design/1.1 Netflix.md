# How Netflix uses advanced load balancing:

**1. Goals:** The Netflix Cloud Gateway team aims to reduce errors, increase availability, and improve Netflix's resilience to failures¹. Even a low rate of errors at their scale can degrade the experience for their members¹.

**2. Background:** Historically, Netflix used the Ribbon load balancer with a round-robin algorithm and some filtering mechanisms for blacklisting servers that have a high connection failure rate¹. Over the years, they've made significant improvements, but for some particularly troublesome origin clusters, they would still see much higher load-related error rates than desirable¹.

**3. Guiding Principles:** They decided to work within the constraints of the existing load balancer framework, apply learnings from others, avoid distributed state, and design with reuse in mind from the get-go¹.

**4. Load-Balancing Approach:** An overarching idea was that while the best source of data for a servers’ latency is the client-side view, the best source of data on a servers’ utilization is from the server itself¹. Combining these 2 sources of data should give the most effective load-balancing¹.

**5. Choice-of-2 Algorithm:** They use a choice-of-2 algorithm to choose between servers¹. They primarily balance based on the load balancers’ view of a servers’ utilization and secondarily balance based on the servers’ view of its utilization¹.

**6. Probation and Server-Age Based Mechanisms:** They use probation and server-age based mechanisms for avoiding overloading newly launched servers¹. They also decay collected server stats to zero over time¹.

**7. Elastic Load Balancing:** Netflix uses Amazon's elastic load balancing service to route the traffic to different front-end services³. ELBs are set up in such a way that the load is first balanced across the zones and it moves towards the instances (Two-tier balancing scheme)³.

**8. User Distribution:** Netflix has the following load-balancing goals: Distribute connections evenly across servers, to best utilize hardware capabilities. Dynamically allocate and deallocate servers, to react to changes. Minimize connection churn, which is the maximum movement of users from one server to another, when adding or removing servers².

**9. Routing with Maps:** On receiving a request from a user, they send the request to a user-dedicated server². When a user registers, they are allotted a server for life².

**10. Hashing:** Instead of statically mapping users to servers, they dynamically allocate users using hashing². The idea is simple: Hash requests based on user_id. This gives them a number. Also, hash all server ids to get numbers. Find the server hash closest to the user hash, and assign the request to it².

By using these advanced load balancing techniques, Netflix ensures that its extensive cloud-based infrastructure can handle the high demand from its users, providing a smooth and enjoyable streaming experience.
