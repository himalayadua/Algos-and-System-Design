# Design Spotify

### How does this work in an interview?

**Initial Discussion and Assumptions**
- The interviewee requests 
    - make some assumptions 
    - takes notes for the system design
  
- Ask the main use case they want to focus on 
    - the use cases of finding and playing music on Spotify
    - ask the number of users and songs on Spotify to understand the scale of the system
        - Estimates one billion users and capacity for 75 million songs.

### Calculation of Data Metrics

- Calculate the amount of data based on the number of songs and users.
  - total audio data -> around 1.5 petabytes.
  - song metadata -> around 2 gigabytes 
  - user metadata -> around 1 terabyte

### Discussion on Higher Level Design and Scalability

- The interviewee discusses the basic components of the system design.
  
  - Plans to draw the components and discuss them in more detail later.
  - Acknowledges the need to consider traffic and scaling in the design process.

This is the comprehensive summary of the key arguments presented in the provided transcript. All important findings, conclusions, and recommendations have been covered, as per the user's request.

### Key Components of System Design Interviews (10:03 - 20:01)

- The system involves a mobile phone with the Spotify app, which communicates with application servers and web servers via a load balancer.
  
  - Components include the phone, application server, web server, and load balancer.

### Database Structure

- The system includes a database that the web servers communicate with.
  
  - The database is split into a song audio database and a metadata database.
    
    - The song audio database stores immutable data such as music files, suitable for a blob storage system like Amazon S3.
    - The metadata database stores user information, song details, and allows for querying and updates, suitable for a relational database like Amazon RDS.
- The decision to split the databases is based on access patterns, data size, and query types.

### Use Cases and Data Retrieval

- Use cases for finding and playing music are considered for the Spotify app.
  
  - The app needs to request and retrieve music based on user input, such as artist names or filters.
  - Different databases may be accessed based on the specific use case, with distinct data retrieval requirements for each.

This hierarchical structure provides a comprehensive summary of the key arguments presented in the video transcript, covering the main findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

### Searching for Music (20:06 - 30:01)

- The user inputs a query in the app to find music based on a particular genre.
  
  - The query is sent to the web server through a load balancer, and the web server issues a query to the relational database to find a list of songs with metadata.
  - The search does not require accessing the music files (MP3s) but only the metadata database, making the process efficient.

### Playing Music

- When the user selects a song to play, a request is sent from the app to the web server.
  
  - The web server retrieves the audio link from the database and may need to fetch the audio from the storage database.
  - To stream the audio back to the application, a WebSocket connection may be needed to send data in chunks, or the audio may be read from storage into memory for instant streaming.

### Challenges and Solutions

- The potential challenges of handling a large volume of song requests, especially for popular or newly released songs, are discussed.
  
  - The possibility of overloading the system with simultaneous requests for a popular song, leading to bottlenecks and high bandwidth usage, is highlighted.
  - The use of a content delivery network (CDN) as a cache to reduce the load on the back end and manage popular song requests efficiently is proposed.

### Integration with Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- The process of integrating the CDN with Spotify's web servers to manage popular song requests is outlined.
  
  - The web servers keep track of requested songs and may load popular songs into the CDN for efficient delivery.
  - The application checks the CDN for requested songs before interacting with the web server, ensuring efficient handling of popular and newly released songs.

### Caching (30:07 - 40:02)

- Caching is an important aspect of the design to help with the bottleneck of popular songs.
  
  - The web server keeps track of multiple requests for the same song and then instructs the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to fetch the song, optimizing performance.
  - Mark emphasizes the significance of caching in the design and its role in enhancing user experience and reducing system load.

### Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Edge Caching

- Cloudfront, an AWS technology, is discussed as a CDN that helps with offloading the web servers.
  
  - Mark suggests using technologies like Cloudfront for edge caching to improve performance and alleviate bottlenecks.
  - He also mentions the possibility of caching the songs locally on the user's device for further optimization.

### Load Balancing

- Load balancing is crucial for preventing server overload and ensuring good service to end users.
  
  - Mark explains the need to consider different metrics, such as network bandwidth and memory for caching, for load balancing in a streaming data scenario.
  - He emphasizes the importance of making the load balancer smarter to handle various metrics for efficient load distribution.

### Data Replication and Global Data Placement

- Mark discusses the importance of data replication for availability during outages and for placing replicas closer to where the users are located.
  
  - He mentions the idea of a Geo-aware strategy for data placement and replication to ensure faster access to music and metadata based on regional preferences.
  - Mark suggests a replication strategy tailored to the global nature of the app, considering the popularity of certain music genres in specific regions.

### Feedback on Design Presentation (40:08 - 42:03)

- It's a good idea to wrap up your answer by referring back to the requirements laid out at the beginning of the interview.
  
  - Confirming that your design meets the initial requirements adds a professional touch to the presentation.
- Considering different dimensions of the problem can lead to a more complex yet comprehensive design.
  
  - Exploring additional dimensions, like geolocation in this case, could open up new aspects of the design.

### Reflection on Interview Performance

- Feeling good about the interview performance is natural and indicates confidence.
  
  - Acknowledging that one may have missed some things shows self-awareness and openness to feedback.
- Being on the other side of the interview process can be a different yet enjoyable experience.
  
  - Openness to receiving feedback demonstrates a growth mindset and willingness to improve.

### Conclusion and Call to Action

- Encouraging viewers to like, subscribe, and visit the website for more resources is a standard practice for content creators.
  
  - Offering free resources and expert feedback sessions adds value to the viewers' experience.
- Wishing good luck to the viewers with their interviews creates a positive and supportive closing note.
  
  - Mentioning specific companies like Google, meta, and Amazon adds credibility to the expert feedback sessions.
