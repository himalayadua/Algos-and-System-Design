# System Design Tips
- you can't even cover 30% in a real interview
- Interviewers usually don't care too much about trivial stuff like database model, API design and trivial services.
- System design interviews are generally focussed on particular area of a large system. 
- example
    - the focus was only on designing video upload and stream service and scaling (not just horizontally) it. 
    - interviewer might say - not allowed to use CDN - design it 
- Don't blindly start capacity estimation, API design or data model design
    - ask your interviewer if he is interested in that.

> Remember - Key is to communicate well with your interviewer and ensure he is satisfied with your knowledge. 
>> Focus on what they say and the direction they want the design to go.
