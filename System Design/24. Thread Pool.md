# Thread Pool:

    Pros: Efficient use of resources, controlled resource usage, quick task start-up.
    Cons: Complexity, potential resource contention.
    CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound tasks: CPU-bound tasks spend most of their time using the CPU, while I/O-bound tasks spend time waiting for external operations (like disk or network operations).
    Graceful Shutdown: Properly terminating threads and releasing resources when shutting down a pool.
